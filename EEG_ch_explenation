EEG.Fp1 and EEG.Fp2 (Frontopolar regions, left and right sides):
These channels are associated with executive functions related to visual attention,
decision-making, and cognitive control during visual observation tasks.

EEG.AF3 and EEG.AF4 (Anterior Frontal regions, left and right sides):
These channels are involved in cognitive processes such as attention allocation,
anticipation, and emotional regulation during visual tasks.

EEG.F3 and EEG.F4 (Frontal regions, left and right sides):
These channels play a role in motor planning, attentional control, and higher-order visual
processing, including object recognition and categorization.
